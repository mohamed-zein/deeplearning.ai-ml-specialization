# Week 1: Neural Networks
## Neural networks intuition
### Neurons and the brain
* _Neural Networks_ has started with the motivation of trying to build software to mimic the brain.
* Since around 2005, it has been rebranded into _Deep Learning_.
* Currently they are used in many fields like:
    * Speech Recognition
    * Computer Vision
    * Natural Language Processing

* The artificial neural network uses a very simplified Mathematical model of what a biological neuron does
    * What a neuron does is it takes some inputs, one or more inputs, which are just numbers. 
    * It does some computation and it outputs some other number, which then could be an input to a second neuron.
    * When you're building an artificial neural network or deep learning algorithm, rather than building one neuron at a time, you often want to simulate many such neurons at the same time.
