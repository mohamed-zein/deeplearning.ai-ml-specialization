# Week 3: Classification
## Motivations
Classification is different from Regression in that the output $y$ is only one of handful of possible values.
### Binary classification
* In Binary classification, $y$ can only be one of **two** values, classes or categories.
*  The output class or category will be denoted as:
    * **no** or **yes**
    * `false` or `true`
    * $0$ or $1$ (most commonly used)
    * **negative class** or **positive class**
        * **negative** and **positive** doesn't imply _bad_ vs _good_ but rather convey the message of _absence_ vs _presence_.
